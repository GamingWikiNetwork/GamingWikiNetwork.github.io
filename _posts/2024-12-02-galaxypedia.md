Today we are welcoming **Galaxypedia** as our newest member!

The **Galaxypedia** is a place where everything related to the Roblox game Galaxy is documented. Things like ships, ship data, turrets, guides, events, incidents, and much more are all documented there. The Galaxypedia is the successor to the Galaxy Wiki. The Galaxypedia uses data supplied by the game itself to stay up-to-date.

Check out the wiki at [https://galaxypedia.org](https://wiki.galaxy.casa/)!
