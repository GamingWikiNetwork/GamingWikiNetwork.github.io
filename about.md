The **Gaming Wiki Network** (GWN) was founded on October 15, 2020 by Results May Vary (RMV), who has since been expelled, is a network of independently-hosted wikis about video game franchises. Originally with six wikis and three affiliates, the Gaming Wiki Network aims to support all gaming communities in building independently-hosted wikis. The GWN currently has [{{site.data.members.size}} members]({{site.baseurl}}/members) and [{{site.data.affiliates.size}} affiliates]({{site.baseurl}}/affiliates).

As of March 11, 2022, GWN has been led by new leadership comprised of various representative staff members from the member wikis of the GWN.
